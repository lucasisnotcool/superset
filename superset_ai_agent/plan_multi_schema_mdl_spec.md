# Feature Spec: Multi-Schema MDL Semantic Projects

**Status:** Draft for review
**Scope:** `superset_ai_agent/` (FastAPI / semantic layer) + `superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/AiAgentPanel/SemanticLayerEditor/`
**Author intent:** Lift the "one MDL project = one physical schema" constraint so a single semantic project can model tables drawn from **multiple schemas** of the same database, with correct authoring, validation, onboarding, access control, and UI.

> Line numbers are anchors captured against branch `master` at authoring time. Symbols are stable; re-grep if a line has drifted.

## 1. Problem statement

MDL (**Modeling Definition** — wren-core's native semantic manifest) projects are currently hard-scoped to a single `(database, catalog, schema)` tuple. A user who wants to model `sales.orders` joined to `crm.customers` cannot do it in one project: the project, onboarding, validation, and UI all assume one schema. Real warehouses spread a single business domain across schemas (staging vs marts, per-team schemas, source vs derived), so the one-schema boundary forces either (a) duplicating/denormalizing tables into one schema, or (b) splitting one logical model across disconnected projects that cannot express cross-schema joins.

### 1.1 The pivotal finding — the engine is *already* multi-schema

The single-schema limit is **an organizational boundary the fork added on top of wren-core, not an engine constraint.** Two independent confirmations:

- **Code.** Every `MdlModel` already carries its own physical location via `MdlTableReference { catalog, schema, table }` ([mdl_schema.py:81-102](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/mdl_schema.py#L81-L102)). The manifest's *root* `catalog`/`schema` ([mdl_schema.py:162-163](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/mdl_schema.py#L162-L163), [mdl_compile.py:58-59](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/mdl_compile.py#L58-L59)) is wren-core's **logical namespace**, not a filter on which physical tables models may reference. `compile_manifest` merges per-model bodies through unchanged ([mdl_compile.py:98-127](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/mdl_compile.py#L98-L127)) — nothing collapses or rewrites `tableReference.schema`.
- **WrenAI docs.** *"Catalog and schema … define the Wren Engine namespace — they have nothing to do with your database's catalog or schema. The actual database location of each table is specified per-model in the table_reference section. This architecture allows you to define multiple models across different database schemas while maintaining a unified semantic layer."* ([What is MDL](https://docs.getwren.ai/oss/concepts/what_is_mdl))

**Implication:** we are not changing the engine contract. A manifest with `model A → tableReference.schema=sales` and `model B → tableReference.schema=crm` already compiles and rewrites SQL today. The work is to stop *forbidding* it in the layers wrapped around the engine.

### 1.2 Where the single-schema assumption actually lives

| Layer | Assumption | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **DB constraint** | Unique `(database_uri_fingerprint, catalog_name, schema_name, deleted_at)` → one active project per schema | `persistence/models.py:216-228` |
| **Project model** | `schema_name: str` (required, scalar) | `semantic_layer/schemas.py` `SemanticProject` |
| **Project resolution** | `resolve(...)` matches exactly one `schema_name` | `semantic_layer/projects.py` (in-mem + SQLAlchemy) |
| **Onboarding** | Introspects datasets of one schema only | `semantic_layer/onboarding.py:59-147` |
| **Validation index** | `SchemaIndex` built from one schema's tables; "table does not exist in the schema" | `semantic_layer/mdl_validator.py` (`SchemaIndex`, ~L376) |
| **Materializer** | Writes a single `dataSource.schema_name` / `semanticProject.schema` | `wren_materializer.py:58-117` |
| **Access scope** | `ConversationScope.schema_name: str`; resolve proves one schema | `conversations/schemas.py`, `access.py:120-129` |
| **Frontend** | `SemanticLayerEditorProps.schemaName: string`; no schema selector | `SemanticLayerEditor/index.tsx:243-247` |

Note one layer **already anticipated** multi-schema: `SemanticAccessProof.schema_names: list[str]` ([access.py:60](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/access.py#L60)). The proof is plural; only the project and scope are scalar.

---

## 2. Goals / non-goals

**Goals**
- One semantic project can reference tables from **N schemas within the same database/catalog**.
- Onboarding can select tables across multiple schemas in one flow.
- Validation recognizes tables from **any** project schema and reports schema-qualified errors.
- Access control proves the user can read **every** schema the project touches.
- The UI lets the user see and manage the project's schema set; no silent single-schema fallback.
- **Backward compatible**: every existing single-schema project keeps working with zero user action.

**Non-goals (this iteration)**
- **Cross-database** projects (tables from two different physical databases / connection URIs). Out of scope — keeps the URI-fingerprint identity model intact. Revisit later via wren-core `dataSource` per model.
- **Cross-catalog** projects. The catalog stays a single value per project (most backends collapse catalog to the connection). Schema is the axis we open.
- Changing the wren-core manifest contract or the native MDL vocabulary.
- Multi-tenant sharing/visibility model changes beyond what multi-schema access proof requires.

---

## 3. Design options & recommendation

### Option A — One project spans a **set of schemas** (RECOMMENDED)

Replace the scalar `schema_name` scope with a **schema set**: the project is identified by `(database_uri_fingerprint, catalog_name)` plus an associated, mutable set of schemas it is scoped to. Models within it freely reference any in-set schema via their existing `tableReference.schema`. The wren-core root `schema` becomes a fixed logical namespace (e.g. the project id or `"wren"`), decoupled from physical schemas — exactly as the WrenAI docs prescribe.

- **Pros:** Matches the engine's actual model and every industry peer (dbt sources, Cube `schema.table`, LookML `sql_table_name`). Enables cross-schema joins. Minimal engine risk. Natural, single-project UX.
- **Cons:** DB migration (drop/replace unique constraint). Access control must prove a *set* of schemas. Project identity/dedupe semantics change.

### Option B — Multiple single-schema projects + a "project group" overlay

Keep one project per schema; add a grouping entity that compiles several projects into one manifest for query time.

- **Pros:** No change to the per-project invariant; additive.
- **Cons:** Cross-schema joins/relationships have no home (relationships live in a manifest, not across projects). Doubles the surface (group CRUD, group coverage, group provenance). Onboarding/validation/UX still single-schema per unit. Higher total complexity for a worse UX. **Rejected.**

### Option C — Single project, `schema_name` becomes "default schema", models opt out per-table

Leave the DB/project model scalar; treat `schema_name` as a default and let validation/onboarding accept any schema via per-model `tableReference`.

- **Pros:** Smallest backend diff; no migration.
- **Cons:** Access control gap — a model could reference a schema the user was never proven to access (the resolve step only proves the default schema). This is a **security boundary** issue (see §6 R1). Onboarding still can't pick cross-schema tables cleanly. The "default schema" is a leaky abstraction users won't understand. **Rejected for the authz gap**, though its "default schema" idea is folded into Option A as the wren-core namespace.

**Recommendation: Option A.** It is the only option that (a) matches the engine and industry norm, (b) closes the authorization boundary cleanly, and (c) gives a coherent one-project UX. The rest of this spec details Option A.

---

## 4. Feature specification (Option A)

### 4.1 Data model

Introduce an explicit **schema set** owned by the project. Two viable shapes — see **D1**.

- **Project identity** changes from `(fingerprint, catalog, schema)` to `(fingerprint, catalog)` + a name/slug discriminator (since two projects could legitimately model the same database differently). See **D2** for the new uniqueness key.
- **`SemanticProject.schema_names: list[str]`** (ordered, de-duplicated, non-empty) replaces `schema_name: str`. Keep a derived `primary_schema` (first element) for display and for the wren-core namespace default.
- New association table `ai_agent_semantic_project_schemas(project_id, schema_name)` with unique `(project_id, schema_name)` — normalized, queryable, and migration-friendly (vs. a JSON column; see **D1**).
- `AiAgentSemanticProject.schema_name` column is **retained but deprecated** during migration as the "primary schema" mirror to keep old reads working; the association table is authoritative.

### 4.2 Project resolution & lifecycle

- `SemanticProjectResolveRequest` gains `schema_names: list[str]` (back-compat: accept scalar `schema_name` and coerce to a one-element list).
- `resolve(...)` matches on `(fingerprint, catalog)` + project discriminator; **reconciles** the schema set: schemas in the request not yet associated are added (after access proof, §4.4); existing schemas are retained. Removing a schema is an explicit, separate operation (see **D3** — never silently drop a schema that models still reference).
- Adding a schema to a project triggers an **incremental onboarding opportunity** (offer, don't auto-run) for that schema's tables.

### 4.3 Onboarding (multi-schema)

- `onboard_schema_project` generalizes to accept an `OnboardingSelection` whose table entries are **schema-qualified** (`{schema, table}` pairs), spanning any subset of the project's schema set ([onboarding.py:59-147](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/onboarding.py#L59-L147)).
- `SchemaIndex` is built from the **union** of datasets/tables across all project schemas, keyed by `(schema, table)` rather than bare `table` (see **D4** for the collision rule).
- Generated base models set `tableReference.schema` to the table's real schema (not the project default), so cross-schema is correct from first onboarding.

### 4.4 Access control

- `ConversationScope.schema_name: str` → `schema_names: list[str]` (back-compat coercion). `scope_hash` ([store.py](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/store.py)) incorporates the **sorted** schema set so cache identity is stable regardless of order.
- `resolve_project` / `_require_project_permission` must prove access to **every** schema in the set, not just one ([access.py:120-129, 205-214](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/access.py#L120-L214)). `SemanticAccessProof.schema_names` is already plural — wire it through.
- **Authorization invariant (must-hold):** a model whose `tableReference.schema` is **not** in the project's proven schema set is a validation **error** and is excluded from materialization. This is the gate that makes Option A safe where Option C was not (§6 R1).

### 4.5 Validation

- `validate_project_manifest` / `SchemaIndex` resolve a model's table against the **schema named in its `tableReference`** ([mdl_validator.py](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/mdl_validator.py)). Error text becomes schema-qualified: `Model X references table 'crm.customers' that does not exist in any project schema.`
- New validation rule: `tableReference.schema` must be a member of the project schema set (ties to §4.4 invariant).
- Relationship/join conditions referencing cross-schema models are valid as long as both models resolve — no special-casing; wren-core handles the SQL.

### 4.6 Materialization & compilation

- `materialize_wren_project` keeps writing **one** manifest. Root `catalog`/`schema` become the fixed logical namespace (project id-derived), **not** a physical schema ([wren_materializer.py:58-117](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/wren_materializer.py#L58-L117)). Per-model `tableReference.schema` already carries physical location, so the compiled manifest is unchanged in shape — only the root namespace semantics are clarified.
- `dataSource.properties.schema_name` (single) is replaced by `schema_names` (list) for provenance; this is metadata wren-core tolerates (`extra="allow"`).
- `compile_manifest`'s `schema=` parameter becomes the logical namespace, defaulted, not the physical schema.

### 4.7 Frontend / UX

- `SemanticLayerEditorProps.schemaName: string` → `schemaNames: string[]` (accept scalar for back-compat at the call site) ([index.tsx:243-247](superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/AiAgentPanel/SemanticLayerEditor/index.tsx#L243-L247)).
- **Header schema chips + "Add schema" control:** the editor header shows the project's schema set as chips; an "Add schema" affordance opens a schema multi-select (scoped to the current database/catalog) → proves access → reconciles the set → offers onboarding for the new schema.
- **Onboarding picker** (`OnboardingTablePicker.tsx`) gains a schema dimension: a schema selector/grouping above the table list; the `schema` filter becomes `in (schemaSet)` and rows show their schema. Selected tables carry their schema.
- **Schema graph** (`SchemaGraph/SchemaGraph.tsx`) filters physical tables by `schema ∈ schemaSet` and visually groups/colors nodes by schema so cross-schema joins are legible.
- **Default new-model template** prefills `tableReference.schema` from the active schema chip rather than leaving it blank ([index.tsx:223-233](superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/AiAgentPanel/SemanticLayerEditor/index.tsx#L223-L233)).
- Coverage/provenance are already project-level — no schema coupling, no change needed.

### 4.8 Copilot

- `MdlToolset` receives the unioned multi-schema `SchemaIndex`; `get_schema` retrieval ranks across all schemas ([copilot/tools.py](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/copilot/tools.py), [schema_retriever.py](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/schema_retriever.py)). `SchemaItem` gains a `schema` qualifier so retrieved tables are unambiguous and the agent emits correct `tableReference.schema`.

## 5. Decision points

| ID | Decision | Options | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | How to store the schema set | (a) JSON/array column on project; (b) **normalized association table** | **(b)** association table `ai_agent_semantic_project_schemas`. Queryable for resolve/list, enforces uniqueness, indexes cleanly, avoids JSON-in-SQL filtering. JSON column would push set logic into app code and break server-side resolution filters. |
| **D2** | New project uniqueness key (schema removed from it) | (a) `(fingerprint, catalog)` — one project per database; (b) `(fingerprint, catalog, name_slug)` — many named projects per database | **(b)**. (a) would forbid two legitimately different models of one DB and is a one-way door. (b) preserves today's "resolve creates if missing" by using a stable default slug, and unlocks named projects later. Migration maps each existing project to a slug derived from its current `schema_name`. |
| **D3** | Removing a schema from a project | (a) block if any active model references it; (b) cascade-delete those models; (c) soft "detach" leaving orphan models that fail validation | **(a)**. Safest, reversible, no surprise data loss. Surface the blocking models in the error so the user can delete them first. |
| **D4** | Table name collisions across schemas (`sales.orders` vs `archive.orders`) | (a) key `SchemaIndex` by `(schema, table)`, require model names unique; (b) auto-prefix model names by schema | **(a)**. Keep the index `(schema, table)`-keyed so both physical tables are addressable; model **logical** names must still be unique within the manifest (wren-core requirement — see dedupe note [mdl_compile.py:154-162](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/mdl_compile.py#L154-L162)). When onboarding would create two models named `orders`, disambiguate the *logical* name (e.g. `sales_orders`) while `tableReference` stays exact. Don't force prefixes when there's no collision. |
| **D5** | wren-core root `schema` value once decoupled | (a) keep `"public"`/first schema; (b) project-derived logical namespace | **(b)** a fixed, project-stable namespace (e.g. `"wren"` or project slug). Using a real physical schema as the root is the leaky abstraction that caused the confusion; make the decoupling explicit. |
| **D6** | Migration default for existing projects | (a) one-element schema set = current `schema_name`; (b) auto-expand to all sibling schemas | **(a)**. Never widen a user's data scope automatically — that would be a silent access expansion. Existing projects stay exactly as scoped; users opt into more schemas explicitly. |
| **D7** | API back-compat for `schema_name` | (a) hard cut to `schema_names`; (b) accept both, coerce scalar → `[scalar]`, echo both for a deprecation window | **(b)**. Frontend, stored conversations, and any external callers send scalar today; dual-accept avoids a flag-day break. |

---

## 6. Risks & mitigations

| ID | Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** | **Authorization bypass** — a model references a schema the user wasn't proven to access (the Option C gap). | **High (security)** | The §4.4 invariant: materialization/validation **reject** any `tableReference.schema ∉ proven schema set`. Access proof must cover every set member before resolve returns. Add a unit test that a model pointing at an unproven schema is excluded and errors. Map to `SECURITY.md`: principal = `sql_lab`/Gamma with schema-scoped DB access; the matrix row is "data/table access requires proven access to that schema." |
| **R2** | **DB migration on the unique constraint** is irreversible-ish and runs against live `ai_agent.db` volumes (see memory: legacy rows in persistent volume). | **High** | Ship as expand/contract: (1) add association table + backfill from `schema_name`; (2) switch reads to the table; (3) replace the unique index; (4) keep `schema_name` column as primary mirror. Each step independently deployable & reversible. Use `superset.migrations.shared.utils` helpers per `CLAUDE.md`. Test against a copy of a real volume. |
| **R3** | **Cross-worker store drift** — in-memory vs SQLAlchemy project stores must agree on set reconciliation semantics. | Medium | Define reconciliation once in a shared helper; both `InMemorySemanticProjectStore` and `SqlAlchemySemanticProjectStore` call it. Parity test asserts identical resolve behavior for a multi-schema request. |
| **R4** | **Model logical-name collisions** across schemas double-register a physical table and wren-core rejects the manifest (`table … already exists`). | Medium | D4: `(schema,table)`-keyed index + onboarding disambiguates logical names. Validation surfaces duplicate logical names pre-materialization. Existing last-wins dedupe ([mdl_compile.py:154-176](superset_ai_agent/semantic_layer/mdl_compile.py#L154-L176)) is a backstop, not the primary guard. |
| **R5** | **Scope cache poisoning** — `scope_hash`/retriever checksum keyed by scalar schema would alias different schema sets. | Medium | Incorporate the **sorted** schema set into `scope_hash` and retriever `scope_key`. Re-index on set change (already keyed by manifest checksum, which changes when models change). |
| **R6** | **Performance** — onboarding/validation now union N schemas' datasets; large multi-schema DBs inflate the `SchemaIndex` and retrieval corpus. | Low/Medium | Build `SchemaIndex` lazily per resolve; cap onboarding introspection to selected tables (already table-scoped); paginate the multi-schema picker (existing pagination). Log if a project's schema set exceeds a soft cap rather than silently truncating. |
| **R7** | **UX confusion** — users equating the wren-core root `schema` with a physical schema. | Low | D5 fixes the root to a logical namespace; the UI never shows it. UI talks only about the *physical schema set* (chips), matching the user's mental model. |
| **R8** | **Stale single-schema conversations** referencing a project whose set later grew. | Low | Conversations store scope, not project internals; D7 coercion keeps old scalar scopes valid (they prove a subset). No migration of conversation rows needed. |

---

## 7. Intent alignment (dev ↔ spec ↔ user)

| Layer | Stated intent | Spec realization | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Engine/dev** | "One semantic layer over a business domain, physical location is per-table." (wren-core design) | Root namespace decoupled (D5); per-model `tableReference.schema` is the source of truth; manifest shape unchanged. | Native-manifest contract test still green; new test: 2-schema manifest compiles + rewrites a cross-schema join. |
| **Backend/dev** | "A project is the unit of authoring, access, coverage." | Project keeps being the unit; only its *scope* widens from one schema to a set, gated by per-schema access proof. | Resolve/list/access parity tests (in-mem ↔ SQLAlchemy); authz test for R1. |
| **User intent** | "Model my orders-and-customers domain that lives in `sales` and `crm` together." | Add both schemas to one project; onboard tables from both; join across them; one coverage/provenance timeline. | E2E: create project, add 2nd schema, onboard a table from each, author a cross-schema relationship, validate green. |
| **User flow ↔ UI** | "I should see and control which schemas my project covers." | Header schema chips + Add-schema; multi-schema onboarding picker; schema-grouped graph. No hidden default-schema behavior. | UI test: chips reflect set; adding a schema proves access then offers onboarding; removing a referenced schema is blocked with a clear message (D3). |

---

## 7a. Implementation status (as built)

**Shipped & tested (backend + core frontend):**
- **Model layer** — `normalize_schema_names` + `schema_names` on `SemanticProject` / `SemanticProjectResolveRequest` / `ConversationScope` / `SemanticLayerState`; `schema_name` retained as the primary (back-compat). `scope_hash` is byte-identical for single-schema scopes, distinct+order-independent for multi (R5). *(`test_multi_schema_models.py`)*
- **DB** — `ai_agent_semantic_project_schemas` association table + migration `0010` with primary-schema backfill (expand step, reversible). *(`test_multi_schema_migration.py`)*
- **Stores** — both in-memory and SQLAlchemy: resolve matches by primary then membership (reopening on a secondary schema finds the same project), reconciles the set additively, persists/loads memberships, lists by membership. *(`test_multi_schema_projects.py`)*
- **Access (R1)** — `require_schema_set_permission` proves every schema in the set and returns the union context; `resolve_project` / project re-open prove the full set. *(`test_multi_schema_access.py`)*
- **Validation (R1 + D4)** — `SchemaIndex` is schema-qualified (degrades closed on the names-only snapshot); models referencing an out-of-set schema error (`schema_not_in_project`); unknown-table messages are schema-qualified; column checks respect schema on table-name collisions. *(`test_multi_schema_validation.py`)*
- **Onboarding (D4)** — base-model generation disambiguates colliding logical names by schema (tableReference stays exact); the onboard endpoint unions every member schema for whole-project introspection. *(`test_multi_schema_onboarding.py`)*
- **Materializer** — `dataSource.properties.schema_names` + `semanticProject.schemas` exposed; root schema stays the primary (logical namespace).
- **Frontend** — `schema_names` on the API types; the editor seeds resolve with the set and renders header **schema chips** + an **Add-schema** control (proves access server-side, then offers onboarding). *(`SchemaSetControl.test.tsx`)*

**Deferred (with rationale):**
- **Multi-schema onboarding *picker* + physical schema *graph overlay*** — the per-schema table-selection picker and the physical-table graph overlay still center on the primary schema. Both require integration-heavy refactors of single-schema data hooks (`useSchemaGraphData`, the picker's `schema eq` dataset fetch) with their own integration-test surface. **Functionally covered**: the whole-project "Onboard" path already introspects the union of all member schemas, so a newly-added schema's tables *are* onboardable; only the granular per-schema selection UI is pending. **Gap to flag to users:** after adding a schema, use "Onboard" (whole-project) rather than expecting the table picker to list the new schema's tables.
- **Phase 4 contract swap (unique-index replacement, D2b named projects) + scalar-echo retirement (D7)** — **not required for multi-schema**: the existing `(fingerprint, catalog, schema_name, deleted_at)` unique constraint still holds (it pins the *primary* schema; additional schemas live in the membership table), so resolve never creates duplicates. The swap is only needed to unlock *multiple named projects per database* (a separate future capability) and carries migration risk against persistent `ai_agent.db` volumes — correctly deferred to a dedicated change. Retiring the scalar `schema_name` (D7) must wait out a deprecation window.

## 8. Phasing (independently shippable)

1. **Phase 0 — Decouple root namespace (no scope change).** Make wren-core root `schema` a fixed logical namespace (D5); confirm existing single-schema projects unaffected. Pure refactor, no migration. De-risks the engine assumption before touching scope.
2. **Phase 1 — Data model + access (backend).** Association table + backfill (R2 expand/contract); `schema_names` on project/scope/resolve with scalar coercion (D7); access proof over the set (R1). Reads still single-schema in practice.
3. **Phase 2 — Onboarding + validation multi-schema.** Schema-qualified `SchemaIndex` (D4), multi-schema onboarding, schema-qualified validation errors, R1 invariant enforced.
4. **Phase 3 — Frontend.** `schemaNames` prop, header chips/Add-schema, multi-schema picker, schema-grouped graph, copilot `SchemaItem.schema`.
5. **Phase 4 — Contract.** Replace the unique index (R2 step 3), retire the deprecated scalar echo after the window (D7).

Each phase ends with `pytest tests/unit_tests/superset_ai_agent/ -q`, the named UI tests, and `pre-commit run` on staged files, per `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## 9. Open questions for the user

- **Named projects (D2b):** do you want the door open for *multiple* projects per database now, or is "one project per database, multi-schema" sufficient for the first release? (D2b keeps it open cheaply; confirm before committing the uniqueness key.)
- **Cross-database** modeling — confirmed out of scope this round? (Non-goal §2.)
- **Schema set soft cap** (R6) — is there an expected upper bound (e.g. ≤ 10 schemas/project) we should design the picker UX around?
