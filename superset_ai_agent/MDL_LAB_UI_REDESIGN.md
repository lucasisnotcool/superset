# MDL Lab — UI Reorganisation: Audit & Redesign Proposal

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (UP1–UP5), tested, in the working tree (uncommitted) — pending the user's visual/manual QA.
Companion to `MDL_LAB.md` (as-built), `MDL_LAB_GAP_CLOSURE.md` (follow-ups), `plan_mdl_lab_spec.md` (rationale).

## As-built (UP1–UP5)
- **UP1** `CopilotPanel` header stacks vertically (title above wrapping action buttons) — no more one-char-per-line.
- **UP2** "New project" opens `NewProjectModal` (name + **schema multi-select**, first = primary); create proves
  access to every chosen schema. The browse-first "create needs a schema" guard is gone.
- **UP3** The per-schema tree action is removed (`TreeNodeRenderer` + `TableExploreTree`); the DB-level
  "Open MDL Lab" toolbar button + `projectId` deep-link are the only entries.
- **UP4** Structural inversion in `SemanticLayerEditor/index.tsx`: a top-level master–detail `EditorSplitter` —
  **`ProjectBrowser` is the left master**, the **selected project's workspace** is the right detail. The global
  `EditorHeader` is deleted; **Models/Instructions/Graph are sub-tabs of the workspace** (`ContentTabs` moved
  inside, no longer the parent of the browser). Relocated bits: schema set + add, provenance history, Copilot
  toggle, coverage badge, and the state/doc-count badge → a thin **workspace strip**; project name → removed
  (implied by the highlighted browser row). Schema-aware sub-views (instructions, graph, onboarding) derive scope
  from a new **`projectScope`** (the opened project), not the entry tab. Empty workspace state when no project.
  **Cross-schema onboarding**: `OnboardingTablePicker` gains a schema selector; registered-dataset selections
  (keyed by global id) **accumulate across schemas** for a single onboard pass.
- **UP5** Removed dead `openSemanticLayerEditor`/`buildSemanticLayerEditorId`; `SemanticLayerEditorTab.schemaName`
  is now vestigial (always unset). Tests repointed to `openMdlLab`.

**Tests:** all touched suites green (SemanticLayerEditor 23 suites, TableExploreTree, TabbedSqlEditors, api.ts —
232 passing); tsc + prettier clean. New tests: Copilot header, NewProjectModal (schema gating + multi), MDL Lab
toolbar-only entry, empty workspace, projectId/browse entry, cross-schema picker accumulation. The 2 pre-existing
`AiAgentPanel/index.test.tsx` + `ExplainDialog.test.tsx` SQL-render failures are unrelated and untouched.

## As-built — Onboarding tree + pipeline fixes (post-UP5 round)

This round answered four follow-ups: a nested onboarding tree, true cross-schema accumulation, a project
deselect/blank bug, and schema correctness for the agent/engine.

- **OT1 — Onboarding is now a collapsible schema→tables tree** (`OnboardingTablePicker.tsx`, full rewrite). The
  per-schema **dropdown selector is gone**; every project schema renders as a header with its tables indented
  underneath, **all expanded by default**, each collapsible (caret) like the SQL Lab DB browser. Still virtualized
  (`react-window`), so a 2000-row schema stays bounded. Per-schema header carries a tristate "select all in
  schema" checkbox + a `R of P registered` count; unregistered physical tables list per schema for inline
  registration (registered in **their own schema**, not the primary).
- **OT2 — Selections genuinely add up across schemas.** Selection is now an explicit `include` model: registered
  datasets keyed by **global id** (`included`), unregistered tables keyed by **schema+name** (`includedNew`). The
  footer count and "Onboard N table(s)" reflect the **cross-schema total**, and **Select all** spans every schema.
  The old Gmail-style `mode:'all'` (single-schema, exclude-set) is dropped from the picker — the backend's
  `include` path is id-driven and cross-schema native (`app.py:_onboarding_context`), so it onboards the chosen
  ids regardless of how many schemas they span. `loadSchema` renders registered rows first, then merges the
  advisory physical-tables scan, so a slow/failed physical lookup can never blank the rows.
- **OT3 — Onboarding no longer deselects/blanks the open project.** Root cause: in the Lab (project-keyed entry)
  the tab carries no schema, so `scope.schema_name` is empty; `runOnboard` and the completion poller called the
  scope-based `refresh()`, which at that guard did `setProject(null)` — wiping the workspace on onboard start and
  on completion. Fix: a new **`refreshOpenProject()`** reloads the currently-open project **by id** (identity
  stable, never nulls), and `runOnboard` + the poller use it; the scope `refresh` remains only for the legacy
  schema-tree entry. [`SemanticLayerEditor/index.tsx`]
- **OT4 — Multi-schema projects now validate/generate against their FULL schema set.** `_schema_index_for_project`
  fetched only the primary schema, so for a project spanning N schemas the R1 invariant wrongly rejected — and the
  Copilot was blind to — tables in the **secondary** schemas. It now **unions every member schema** (mirroring
  onboarding). Model *names* and per-model `tableReference {schema, table}` were already correct (D4 collision
  rename + per-dataset schema), so the compiled manifest the wren engine executes always carried the right schema;
  this fix aligns the **validation/Copilot index** with it. Snapshot-fallback (Superset outage) stays names-only
  by design, but now serializes the unioned set. [`app.py`, regression: `test_multi_schema_schema_index.py`]

- **OT5 — Cross-schema onboarding actually onboarded only ONE schema (fixed).** Root cause: the include-mode
  fetch passed a single `schema_name` (the primary) **alongside** the cross-schema `dataset_ids`, and **all three
  Superset providers** (`client.py` SQLAlchemy, `mcp.py`, `rest.py`) intersect `schema AND ids` — so datasets in
  the project's *secondary* schemas were silently dropped. This is the classic *silent-narrowing* anti-pattern: an
  orthogonal scope filter quietly shrinking a precise primary-key selection (cf. "fail fast / make invalid states
  unrepresentable", Ousterhout *A Philosophy of Software Design* ch. on errors; "Don't return partial results
  silently"). Three-part fix: (a) **`_onboarding_context`** fetches by ids alone (`schema_name=None`); (b) all
  three providers made **ids-authoritative** (an explicit id selection is never narrowed by `schema_name`; DB
  scope still bounds it — prevents cross-DB leak); (c) a **project-schema-set boundary guard**
  (`_enforce_onboarding_schema_boundary`, F5/R1) drops any dataset whose schema is outside the project's proven
  set even if its id was supplied, and **logs a reconciliation shortfall** so a silent drop surfaces (defense in
  depth — R1 also rejects at activation). [`app.py`, `integrations/superset/{client,mcp,rest}.py`]

**Tests (this round):** `OnboardingTablePicker.test.tsx` rewritten (18 tests: tree render, collapse/expand,
cross-schema accumulation + count, per-schema + global select-all, cross-schema inline registration,
virtualization, permissions); `index.test.tsx` onboarding tests green; `test_cross_schema_onboarding.py` (2: include
onboarding spans every selected schema + boundary guard drops out-of-set ids); `test_multi_schema_schema_index.py`
(2). Backend **912 passed** (+4 new across the round). tsc + prettier + jest + ruff/black (own files) clean.

**Residual UI notes (for QA):**
1. **Readiness + coverage badges live in the workspace strip**, not (yet) in the ProjectBrowser rows — the plan
   floated rows; the strip is a valid relocation and lower-risk. Moving them to rows is a follow-up.
2. **Copilot rail is scoped to the Models sub-tab** (editor-adjacent). The toggle is in the workspace strip, but
   the rail only renders on Models; on Instructions/Graph there is no rail. Acceptable per the "rail beside the
   editor" decision; a workspace-level rail is a larger follow-up.
3. **Doc count** is surfaced via the relocated state badge (`%s document(s)`) in the strip — not a per-Documents-
   group badge on the tree. Equivalent information, simpler placement.
4. **Cross-schema onboarding (OT1/OT2):** the picker is a collapsible schema→tables tree; registered + unregistered
   selections accumulate across **all** schemas and the count is the true total. The single-schema Gmail-style
   "all" mode is removed (the confirmed selection is always an explicit cross-schema `include` list). Whole-project
   onboarding (no explicit selection) remains available via the Onboard banner.
5. **No live/visual QA performed** — all covered by unit/integration tests with mocked network.
6. **File/symbol still named `SemanticLayerEditor`** internally; the user-facing surface is "MDL Lab". A rename is
   optional cosmetic cleanup.

> Anchors verified against the working tree; symbols are stable, lines drift.

The six requested changes all reduce to **one structural shift**: today a project is selected *inside* a
schema-keyed editor (the ProjectBrowser is buried in the Models tab's left pane, *under* the
Models/Instructions/Graph tabs). We want the **project to be the unit of navigation** — MDL Lab is a
master-detail surface where the ProjectBrowser is the master and a project's workspace
(Models/Instructions/Graph + Copilot) is the detail. This doc audits what exists and proposes the new layout.

---

## Step 1 — Audit (source-backed)

### 1.1 The two confusingly-similar surfaces (ask 4)

There is **one component**, `SemanticLayerEditor/index.tsx`, entered **two ways**:
- **Per-schema** (legacy): schema-tree row action → `openSemanticLayerEditor(db, catalog, schema)` →
  schema-bound tab (`buildSemanticLayerEditorId`). [`TreeNodeRenderer.tsx:268-275`,
  `TableExploreTree/index.tsx::handleOpenSemanticLayer`, `actions/sqlLab.ts:881-903`].
- **Browse-first MDL Lab** (new): DB-tree toolbar "Open MDL Lab" → `openMdlLab(db, catalog)` → schema-less tab
  (`buildMdlLabId`) [`TableExploreTree/index.tsx::handleOpenMdlLab`, `actions/sqlLab.ts::openMdlLab`].

Both render the same editor; the only difference is whether the tab carries a `schemaName`. This is the "similar
layout, slightly-off" confusion. **Deprecation = collapse to the browse-first entry only.**

Tabs live in redux `semanticLayerEditors[]` + `activeSemanticLayerEditorId`
(`types.ts:87-102`, reducer `OPEN/CLOSE/SET_ACTIVE_SEMANTIC_LAYER_EDITOR`). They are **not persisted**
(`persistSqlLabStateEnhancer` excludes them) — so no migration/cleanup of stored state is needed.

### 1.2 Current layout tree (`SemanticLayerEditor/index.tsx`)

```
SemanticLayerEditor (tab)
├── EditorHeader  ← the "top bar" (ask 5: remove)
│   ├── project.name                         (Typography.Title)        → remove (implied by browser)
│   ├── Provenance button (HistoryOutlined)  → setShowProvenance       → move
│   ├── CoverageBadge (projectId)            → move
│   ├── SemanticLayerStateBadge (state)      → move
│   ├── SchemaSetControl (schema tags + Add) → move
│   └── Copilot toggle button                → move (relocate, not delete)
└── ContentTabs  ← OUTER tabs (ask 6: must become INNER, per-project)
    ├── "Models"   → EditorSplitter[ BrowserPane | EditorPane | CopilotRail? ]
    │     • BrowserPane = ProjectBrowser  ← the MDL Lab list, buried here (ask 6 problem)
    │                   + Save/New + WorkspaceTree(files+docs) + Activate-all
    │                   + Upload document + Reset
    │     • EditorPane  = MDL JSON editor  OR  DocumentDetailPane (when a doc is selected)
    │     • CopilotRail = CopilotPanel (shown when showCopilot && project)
    ├── "Instructions" → InstructionsPanel (scope-keyed)
    └── "Graph"        → SchemaGraph (scope-keyed)
+ OnboardingTablePicker (modal), rename/duplicate/reset ConfirmModals, MdlProvenanceDialog
```

### 1.3 Scope dependency of each sub-component (the reroute crux, ask 4)

The editor builds `scope` from **tab props** (`databaseId, catalogName, schemaName`). After deprecation the tab is
browse-first (no schema), so anything reading the tab's schema must instead read the **opened project**
(`project.schema_name` / `project.schema_names`).

| Sub-component | Scope source today | Needs schema? | Reroute |
|---|---|---|---|
| `InstructionsPanel` | tab `scope` (gates on `scope.schema_name`) | **Yes** | derive scope from opened project |
| `SchemaGraph` | tab `schemaName` | **Yes** | use project's schema(s) |
| `OnboardingTablePicker` | tab `schema` (lists physical tables for one schema) | **Yes (singular)** | add a schema selector (project's `schema_names`, default primary) |
| `CopilotPanel` | `project.id` | No | none |
| `useDocumentIngestion` (upload) | `project.id` | No | none |
| `DocumentDetailPane` | selected doc | No | none |
| `CoverageBadge` | `project.id` | No | none |
| `MdlProvenanceDialog` | `project.id` | No | none |
| `SchemaSetControl` | `databaseId/catalog` + project schema set | partial | already project-driven |

**The only functional break** under browse-first is `OnboardingTablePicker`: it lists physical tables for a single
`schema`, so a multi-schema project opened with no schema can't onboard until a schema is chosen. The
`onboard`/`upload` **backend endpoints are project-keyed and schema-agnostic** — this is purely a UI input gap.

### 1.4 Feature inventory (everything that must survive the reroute)

Project CRUD (browser), open/switch project, MDL file CRUD (tree + editor: save draft/activate/validate/delete,
activate-all), document upload + viewer (`DocumentDetailPane`), Copilot chat + changeset apply + coverage +
inspector, onboarding (picker → job → poll), reset, provenance dialog, schema-set view/add, instructions CRUD,
schema graph. All are reachable today only *inside* the editor's tabs.

### 1.5 CopilotPanel header (ask 3)

`CopilotPanel.tsx:649-722` — header is a single `Flex justify="space-between" align="center"` with the
`"MDL Copilot"` title (left) and six action buttons New chat / History / Rename / Delete / Coverage / Inspector
(right). When the rail is narrow the title column is squeezed and wraps one char per line. Fix = stack vertically.

### 1.6 Create-project flow (ask 2)

`index.tsx::handleCreateProject` posts `createSemanticProject({database_id, catalog_name, schema_name,
schema_names})` using the **tab scope's** schema (guarded with a warning when browse-first has none). There is no
schema picker. `SchemaSetControl` already shows how to list a DB's schemas — `useSchemasQuery({dbId, catalog})`
(`src/hooks/apiResources/schemas`) — reusable for a create dialog.

### 1.7 Test surface a redesign disturbs

`TabbedSqlEditors.test.tsx` (semantic tab open/label/close), `SemanticLayerEditor/index.test.tsx` (resolve flow,
onboard banner, browse-first, projectId entry), `TableExploreTree.test.tsx` (per-schema action + MDL Lab toolbar),
`CopilotPanel.test.tsx` (header/actions), `InstructionsPanel.test.tsx` (scope gating), `ProjectBrowser.test.tsx`.

---

## Step 2 — Redesign

### 2.1 Target relationship (the core change)

```
MDL Lab  (single browse-first tab; entered only via "Open MDL Lab")
├── LEFT  — ProjectBrowser  (master; persistent, collapsible)
│     MDL Lab title · [+ New project (schema picker)] · search · grouped rows
│     each row: name · primary schema · schema-count · [readiness] · [coverage]  · ⋯actions
│     (readiness + coverage badges MOVE here from the old top bar — they are per-project)
└── RIGHT — Project Workspace  (detail; the selected project)
      • no project selected → empty state ("Select a project to open, or create one")
      • project selected →
        ┌ workspace context strip (compact, replaces the heavy top bar) ─────────────┐
        │ Schemas: [sales][crm] [+ add]      ⟳ History(provenance)      [Copilot ▸]    │
        └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        └ sub-tabs (now CHILDREN of the project, ask 6):
            [ Models ] [ Instructions ] [ Graph ]
              Models       → file tree (+ doc count badge on Documents) | MDL editor / DocumentDetailPane
              Instructions → InstructionsPanel (scope from PROJECT)
              Graph        → SchemaGraph (scope from PROJECT)
        └ Copilot rail (collapsible, workspace-level; toggled by the strip's [Copilot ▸])
```

Mechanically: **lift `ProjectBrowser` out of the Models tab into the Lab's top-level left Splitter panel**, and
**move `ContentTabs` (Models/Instructions/Graph) into the right (workspace) panel** so they render the selected
project. The old `EditorHeader` is deleted; its contents relocate (below).

### 2.2 Where each removed top-bar item goes (ask 5)

| Item | Decision | New home |
|---|---|---|
| Project name | **Remove** | implied by the highlighted ProjectBrowser row |
| Provenance (history) icon | **Move** | workspace context strip (project-level action) |
| CoverageBadge | **Move** | ProjectBrowser row badge (per-project) |
| Readiness/state badge | **Move** | ProjectBrowser row badge (per-project) |
| Schema set + Add schema | **Move** | workspace context strip (manage project's schemas) |
| Copilot toggle | **Move** | workspace context strip ("Copilot" toggle for the rail) |
| Document count | **Move** (not elsewhere today) | badge on the Models tree "Documents" group (and/or the strip) |

Net: the heavy global header is gone; per-project status lives in the list rows, and the few project-level
*actions* live in a thin workspace strip — not a title bar.

### 2.3 Per-ask change list

- **Ask 1 — single entry.** Remove the per-schema `ActionButton` (`TreeNodeRenderer.tsx:268-275`) and
  `handleOpenSemanticLayer` wiring (`TableExploreTree/index.tsx`); keep the toolbar "Open MDL Lab" button.
- **Ask 2 — create with schemas.** "New project" opens a dialog: name + **multi-select of the DB's schemas**
  (`useSchemasQuery`), first selected = primary, ≥1 required → `createSemanticProject`. Removes the browse-first
  "create needs a schema" guard (the dialog always collects them).
- **Ask 3 — Copilot header.** Make the header a vertical stack: `"MDL Copilot"` title row, then the action-button
  row (wrapping). `CopilotPanel.tsx:649-722`.
- **Ask 4 — deprecate the editor / reroute.** One entry (browse-first). Build a `projectScope` from the **opened
  project** and feed it to `InstructionsPanel`, `SchemaGraph`, and the onboarding default. Retire
  `openSemanticLayerEditor`/`buildSemanticLayerEditorId` + the schema-bound tab branch (keep `projectId`
  deep-link). Internally the component may keep its name; user-facing concept is "MDL Lab".
- **Ask 5 — remove top bar.** Delete `EditorHeader`; relocate per §2.2.
- **Ask 6 — Models/Instructions/Graph as sub-components.** Move `ContentTabs` into the workspace (right) panel,
  rendering the selected project; `ProjectBrowser` becomes the Lab's top-level master pane (not a child of Models).

### 2.4 Onboarding under multi-schema — cross-schema picker (DECIDED)

`OnboardingTablePicker` is **expanded from single-schema to a hierarchical, cross-schema picker**: it lists the
project's **schemas as groups**, each expandable to its **tables**, with the same checkbox UI as today — so a user
can select tables across *multiple* schemas in one pass and onboard them together. Mechanically: iterate the
opened project's `schema_names`, call `listPhysicalTables(databaseId, schema, catalog)` per schema (lazy per group
is fine), render a two-level checkbox tree (schema → tables, with select-all per schema). The onboard selection
already carries dataset/table ids; the backend onboard is project-keyed and schema-agnostic, so no backend change
— the model's `tableReference.schema` is set per selected table. (This also matches the R1 invariant: every
selectable table is from a schema already in the project's proven set.)

---

## Step 3 — Phased implementation plan (for approval; not yet executed)

Each phase ends green (pytest n/a — frontend-only; jest + tsc + prettier) and is independently shippable.

**UP1 — Copilot header (ask 3).** Smallest, isolated. Stack the header vertically in `CopilotPanel.tsx`; update
`CopilotPanel.test.tsx`. *Risk: none.*

**UP2 — Create-project schema picker (ask 2).** New `NewProjectModal` (name + schema multi-select via
`useSchemasQuery`); wire `handleCreateProject` to it; drop the browse-first create guard. Tests: modal selects
schemas → `createSemanticProject` payload; ProjectBrowser `onCreate` opens the modal. *Risk: low (additive).*

**UP3 — Remove per-schema entry (ask 1).** Delete the `TreeNodeRenderer` schema action + `handleOpenSemanticLayer`;
keep the toolbar button. Update `TableExploreTree.test.tsx` (drop the per-schema-action test). *Risk: low.*

**UP4 — The structural reorg (asks 4/5/6) — the large one.** In `SemanticLayerEditor/index.tsx`:
  1. Build `projectScope` from the opened project; pass it to `InstructionsPanel` + `SchemaGraph` (replaces tab
     scope). Add the onboarding schema selector (§2.4).
  2. Delete `EditorHeader`; add a thin workspace context strip (schemas + add, provenance history, Copilot toggle).
  3. Lift `ProjectBrowser` to the Lab's top-level left Splitter panel; move `ContentTabs` into the right panel.
  4. Move readiness + coverage badges into `ProjectBrowser` rows (extend `ProjectBrowserProject` with
     `readiness`/`coverage`); move doc count onto the Models tree's Documents group.
  5. Empty state in the workspace when no project is selected.
  Tests: rewrite `index.test.tsx` layout assertions (browser is top-level; sub-tabs under workspace; no top bar);
  update `InstructionsPanel`/graph scope-from-project; onboarding picker schema select. *Risk: HIGH — touches the
  168-test editor suite + the hot `index.tsx`. Land UP1–UP3 first; do this as one focused pass with full
  manual QA.*

**UP5 — Code cleanup (ask 4 finish).** Remove now-dead `openSemanticLayerEditor`/`buildSemanticLayerEditorId` and
the schema-bound tab branch in `TabbedSqlEditors`; simplify `SemanticLayerEditorTab` (drop `schemaName`, keep
`projectId`). Optional file/symbol rename `SemanticLayerEditor` → `MdlLab`. *Risk: low once UP4 lands; do last.*

Suggested order: **UP1 → UP2 → UP3 → UP4 → UP5** (UP1–UP3 are quick wins and de-risk the big UP4).

### Risks & mitigations
- **R-UI1 (UP4 blast radius):** `index.tsx` is a hot hub with a large test suite. Mitigate: land the small phases
  first; keep `projectScope` derivation additive; one writer; full jest + manual QA before merge.
- **R-UI2 (onboarding multi-schema):** without §2.4 a multi-schema project can't onboard. Mitigate: ship the schema
  selector *in* UP4 (don't split it out).
- **R-UI3 (lost entry points):** removing the per-schema action could strand users who relied on it. Mitigate: the
  DB-tree "Open MDL Lab" button + deep-link entry remain; the project is then one click away in the browser.
- **R-UI4 (instructions scope):** instructions are personal *and* schema-scoped today; deriving scope from the
  project must keep the personal-scope note (DP-NEW) and the per-(owner,scope) keying intact.

### Resolved decisions (locked)
1. **Copilot placement** → collapsible right **rail** in the workspace, toggled from the context strip (chat beside
   the editor). Not a sub-tab.
2. **Documents** → count **badge on the Models tree's Documents group** (minimal; no separate Documents sub-tab).
3. **Onboarding** → **hierarchical cross-schema picker** (§2.4): list schemas → tables with checkboxes, select
   across multiple schemas in one onboard pass. (More than a single default-primary selector — folded into UP4.)
